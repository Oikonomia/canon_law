1 - Since those who for any reason, whether of an ecclesiastical or of physical nature, are absent from the Holy Synod and have remained in their own town or district, ought not to be left in ignorance of the Synod's regulations regarding them, we make known to your holiness and love, that if any metropolitan of the province has apostatized from the holy and ecumenical Synod and joined the assembly of the apostasy, or has joined it thereafter, or has adopted the sentiments of Celestius or intends to adopt them, he shall have no power whatsoever to perpetrate anything against the bishops of the province, being already expelled and stripped of every function and of all ecclesiastical communion by the present Synod. Moreover, he shall be liable in any case, to be expelled from the rank of the episcopate by those very bishops of the province and by surrounding metropolitans who adhere to the beliefs of Orthodoxy.
2 - If, on the other hand, any provincial bishops have failed to attend the Holy Synod and have joined the apostasy, or should attempt to do so, or even after subscribing to the deposition of Nestorius have again gone to the synods of apostasy, all such persons, in the judgment that has seemed best to the Holy Synod, have alienated themselves from Holy Orders and have forfeited their rank.
3 - If some of the clergymen in any city or district have been shorn of Holy Orders by Nestorius and his party on account of their believing rightly, we have adjudged it right and just that they be restored to their own rank. We collectively bid the clergymen who agree in their beliefs with the Orthodox and the Ecumenical Synod not to submit in any way whatever to the bishops who have apostatized or have deserted us.
4 - If any of the clergymen should apostatize and dare, either publicly or privately, to hold the beliefs of Nestorius or of Celestius, the Holy Synod has deemed it just and right that these men too should be deposed.
5 - As for all those who have been condemned by the Holy Synod, or by their own bishops for improper acts, and to whom Nestorius and those sharing his views and beliefs have sought, or should seek, to give back communion or rank, uncanonically and in accordance with the indifference shown by Nestorius in all matters, we have deemed it right and just that they too remain without benefit and that they be left nevertheless deposed.
6 - Likewise in regard to any persons who should wish to alter in any way whatsoever anything that has been enacted by the Holy Synod in Ephesus, concerning anyone, the holy Synod has prescribed that if they be bishops or clergymen, they are to lose their own rank entirely, while if they be laymen, they are to be excluded from communion.
7 - These things having been read aloud, the Holy Synod then decreed that no one should be permitted to offer any different belief or faith, or in any case to write or formulate any other than the one defined by the Holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Spirit in the city of Nicaea. As for those who dare either to formulate a different belief or faith, or to present one, or to offer one to those who wish to turn to acknowledgment of the truth, whether they are Greeks or Jews, or they are members of any heresy whatever; if bishops or clergymen, they shall be deposed as bishops of their episcopate, and as clergymen of their clericate; but if they are laymen, they shall be anathematized. In the same manner, if any persons be discovered or discovered, whether bishops, clergymen or laymen, in the act of believing or teaching the things embodied in the exposition presented by Charisius the Priest concerning the incarnation of the Only-begotten Son of God, or by any chance, the unholy and perverse dogmas of Nestorius which have even been subjoined, let them stand liable to the judgment of this holy and Ecumenical Synod. As a consequence, that is to say, the bishop shall be deprived of his episcopate, and be left deposed, while the clergyman shall likewise forfeit his clericate. If on the other hand any such person is a layman, let him also be anathematized, as aforesaid.
8 - Our fellow Bishop Reginus, most beloved by God, and with him the most God-beloved bishops of the province of the Cypriotes Zeno and Evagrios, have announced an innovation, a thing whichis contrary to the ecclesiastical laws and the Canons of the Holy Apostles, and one which affects the freedom of all. Hence, since common ailments require more drastic treatment, on the ground that they do greater damage, and especially in view of the fact that the Bishop of Antioch, far from following the ancient custom, has been performing the ordinations in Cyprus, according to information given in the Book of Orthodox Documents and by oral statements made by most pious gentlemen who have approached the Holy Synod. Therefore those who preside over the churches in Cyprus shall retain their privilege unaffected and inviolate, according to the Canons of the Holy Fathers and ancient custom, whereby they shall themselves perform the ordinations of the most reverent bishops. The same rule shall hold good also with regard to the other dioceses and churches everywhere, so that none of the bishops most beloved by God shall take hold of any other province that was not formerly and from the beginning in his jurisdiction or was not held by his predecessors. But if anyone has taken possession of any, and has forcibly subjected it to his authority, he shall return it to its rightful possessor, in order that the Canons of the Fathers not be transgressed, nor the secular be introduced, under the pretext of divine services; lest imperceptibly and little by little we lose the freedom which our Lord Jesus Christ, the Liberator of all men, has given us as a free gift by His own Blood. For this reason, it seemed best to the holy and Ecumenical Synod that the rights of every province, formerly and from the beginning belonging to it, be preserved clear and inviolable, in accordance with the custom which prevailed of old, each metropolitan having permission to take copies of the proceedings for his own security. If, on the other hand, anyone introduce any form conflicting with the decrees that have now been sanctioned, it has seemed best to the entire holy and Ecumenical Synod that it shall be of no effect.
